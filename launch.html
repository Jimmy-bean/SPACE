        <h2>Launch</h2>
        <p>Launch: All passengers and crew are accounted for launch. 
            Once the time hits the scheduled time, any last minute passengers will be give a 20 minute 
            warning. Once everyone is on and is time to departure,
            there will be thrusters on the bottom that will make the ship hover in the air. 
            It will stay up for awhile to get the coordinates and trajectory to launch. 
            Once the ship is ready, everyone will have 5 minutes to sit find a seat and sit down with a 
            seat belt. The ship will begin to fly forward and slowly move up into space going faster and 
            faster. Once it exits earths atmosphere, it will begin to to slow down and fix itself at a 
            suitable level, and thus begin the exploration. If anything were to happen during take off, 
            we have emergency shuttles that will fit everyone.

    <div class="recovery">
        <p>Recovery: Once the exploration is complete and heading back to earth the ship 
            will go into a hyperdrive back to earth. Once back to earth and entering the atmosphere 
            everyone will go back to a larg room with the chairs with seatbelts 5 minutes before entering 
            the atmosphere. The ship will fall on its bottom and before it hits the clouds it will use 
            the bottom thrusters at full power, while falling into the ocean incase the ship canâ€™t stop 
            intime. It will be able to float on water and rise if it goes under. It will fly back up 
            and head back to the docking platform that it took off in from the launch.
