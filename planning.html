        <p ALIGN="center">On this special vacation to Saturn, we are going to attempt to do
            as many things as we can with the time we have for this Vacation. We set up a
             laser tag game, and the players are actually going to be blindfolded, the special
              thing about these blindfolds is that they are actually night vision goggles. The
               rules in the game is that the first person to get out, will be having their first
                ticket to Mars. The second person and so on, will all be sent to Jupiter. The person
                 who has been sent on Mars will be going on the new planet with only a gas mask, the participants 
                 inside of our ship will actually feel like they are outside of our ship, and they will think
                  that they have a gas mask on. Us hosts of the ships are putting these certain participants in 
                  crates, these crates will mess with the reality and imaginary realm of the participants. These
                   people in the crates will think that they are away for years and years and they wonâ€™t know how
                    to comprehend reality or imaginary at the time being. The main objective is to base this trip 
                    off of how these certain participants perceive the real world. Once we reach saturn we will have 
                    them all up and out of their crates, we will act as if they have been sleeping, while these participants 
                    were held in their crates we planted wires inside of their head, these wires control thought patterns and 
                    body movements. These participants will be confused of the real world and imaginary world, these two worlds 
                    will be combined inside of their own head. After all of that has happened we leave these people here at Saturn and 
                    we spectate them from afar. Years and Years later we will then host another party and club on one of our special ships, 
                    and we will start again what we started the first time.
